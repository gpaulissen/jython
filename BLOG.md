Setup of Jython for RED, the Robot Framework editor for Eclipse

# Introduction

When you use RED, you can use Python with Robotframework and all its installed libraries (Selenium for instance) to launch tests. However, if you use Maven and thus the Maven Robotframework plugin, you risk to use a different Robotframework version with RED than you use with Maven. Plus, the Python variant in RED cannot use Java libraries like the Maven variant does (which is based on Jython). You may use Jython of course but the last versions 2.7.0 and 2.7.1 did not run well on my Windows 7 laptop due to Pip and DLL problems respectively. And Jython seems to be not so well supported as Python is.

But there seemed to be a solution: [http://nokia.github.io/RED/help/user\_guide/tools\_integration/maven.html](http://nokia.github.io/RED/help/user_guide/tools_integration/maven.html) that describes a way to use the same Robotframework jar as Maven does. In that solution the launch4j program is used to create a Jython executable based on the Robotframework Jar (which includes Jython as well). There are a few snags however as I discovered when I tried to use that approach.

This Blog is written for a Windows environment (tested on Windows 7 and Windows 10), but it might also work on a Unix like environment.

# Problems encountered

## Classpath entries

First, you have to hard code your Jar libraries as Java classpath entries into the launch4j configuration file. That means that if you need a new Jar library you would need to recreate the Jython executable. And I needed not only Robotframework, Selenium but also a JDBC database library and a JMS library. And other projects may have other constraints. Actually what you would like to use is the compile classpath of Maven which has a complete list of jars and its dependencies.

## Jython arguments

The second problem was that RED launches the generated Jython program with arguments not recognized by the robotframework.jar (for instance -J-cp &lt;classpath&gt;) or with arguments just applicable for a Java interpreter like -Dvar=value.

## Java version

The third and last problem was that the launch4j search for the Java executable is a little bit too sophisticated: it uses the Windows registry to look for a system-wide installed JRE/JDK with a minimum and/or maximum version. On the Windows 7 system I was using, only Java 1.7 was installed system-wide and I had no privileges to install a higher version. And the Selenium library really needed Java 1.8.

# A workaround

So what to do?

The first and second problem are actually environment problems. I needed another program to set up an environment (for instance set environment variables, determine the Maven classpath and change the command line) before launching the robotframework.jar with arguments it recognizes. My old friend, script language Perl, came to my rescue. The Windows variant Strawberry Perl allows you to create executables based on Perl scripts using the Perl CPAN module Par::packer.

So the idea is to create an executable named Jython (jython.exe) that is called from the Eclipse RED editor and that sets up the environment before launching Java with the robotframework.jar.

All the build steps must be automated as well of course and what is more easy to use than good old Ant? I really have no idea,  üôÇ

# Installation

Before you start, you may need to install some programs, üôÇ

And since my corporate development machine lacked admin rights that posed some problems, üôÅ

## HTTP proxy

Before you can start to download without a browser, you may need to define an HTTP proxy.

Check if the Internet Explorer settings define a HTTP proxy URL. If so, open that URL in a browser, look for the proxy and set an environment variable https\_proxy, for instance http\_proxy=http://a.b.c.d:port.

## Strawberry Perl

Do not use an installer that needs admin rights.

I used the portable edition, see [http://strawberryperl.com/releases.html](http://strawberryperl.com/releases.html), and installed it in directory C:\Strawberry.

Define an environment variable PERL\_HOME to point to C:\Strawberry\perl. This is needed by Ant later on.

Also define a shortcut on your Desktop with C:\Strawberry\portableshell.bat as target. This helps to start a portable Perl shell.

### Module PAR::Packer

Use the shortcut to start a portable Perl shell. For the rest of this document this will be displayed as:

DOS&gt;

Install PAR::Packer from the CPAN archives:

DOS&gt; cpan PAR::Packer

It takes some time before it is ready with all the tests being executed.

But then you should be able to find pp like this:

DOS&gt; where pp

## Ant

Just download it from the Apache site or use one already on the system:

DOS&gt; dir/s/b c:\ant.bat

Add the Ant bin directory to environment variable PATH: a simple way of doing this is to define ANT\_HOME and add %ANT\_HOME%\bin to PATH.

## Maven

Just download it from the Apache site or use one already on the system:

DOS&gt; dir/s/b c:\mvn.cmd

Add the Maven bin directory to environment variable PATH: a simple way of doing this is to define MAVEN\_HOME and add %MAVEN\_HOME%\bin to PATH.

## Java

You need a Java 1.8 or higher to be installed somewhere and let the environment variable JAVA\_HOME point to that directory.

# Build

You will find these files in the source directory:

- build.xml - an Ant build file
- jython.pl - a Perl script to set up the environment for the robotframework jar

This will create and test the executable:

DOS&gt; ant build test

If there are no errors, you are ready to configure RED.

You can cleanup by:

DOS&gt; ant clean


# Configuration

Before we can run the Jython executable we need to define the Robot framework Java libraries.

## CLASSPATH

The Java CLASSPATH containing the Robot framework Java libraries is set up either using Maven or environment variables.

### Maven

If a file named pom.xml exists in the Eclipse project folder when launching the Jython executable, this command is used by the executable to create a file with dependent jars:

DOS&gt; mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.outputFile=target/classpath.txt 

NOTE: you do not need to run this command yourself!

This is the preferred and most simple way to use the executable.

### Robot framework Java libraries as environment variables

If there is no Maven pom.xml as described above, the Jython executable uses environment variable RF\_JAR and all environment variables named RF\_\*\_JAR to set up CLASSPATH.

You need to run at least once an automated test (a build) with Maven in order to get all the libraries in the %USERPROFILE%\\.m2\repository directory.

In my case I needed just to define this environment variable to run the automated tests in RED:

RF\_JAR=%USERPROFILE%\\.m2\repository\org\robotframework\robotframework\3.0.4\robotframework-3.0.4.jar

The environment variables RF\_\*\_JAR are optional.

## Selenium webdrivers

In order to run Selenium you need their webdrivers (chromedriver.exe, etcetera) either as Java system properties or to be found in the PATH.

The easiest way to set up Selenium webdrivers is to install Katalon Studio and then to set environment variable KATALON_HOME pointing to the installation directory. Then the directories of the Katalon webdrivers will be added to your PATH by the Jython executable and the following webdrivers will be exposed as Java system properties:
* webdriver.chrome.driver
* webdriver.edge.driver
* webdriver.gecko.driver
* webdriver.ie.driver

## RED

Follow the instructions on [https://github.com/nokia/RED](https://github.com/nokia/RED) to install RED in Eclipse if needed.

You may encounter a security warning about unsigned content, but I accepted anyway.

At the end, just click &quot;Restart Now&quot;:

When everything is ready, you will have a Robot perspective.

Go to Window -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Robot Framework -&gt; Installed frameworks and let Eclipse discover all the frameworks (normally that starts automatically). Remove all frameworks but the one framework having as Path c:\jython\bin assuming you installed the sources into c:\jython.

Apply and Close and you are ready!
